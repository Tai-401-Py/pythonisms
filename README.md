### Feature Tasks and Requirements

Dunderlist is a linked list with iterable fuctions and the ability to tell it's own length using top level python methods. 

Pythonisms makes use of str concatination to display it's collection as well as has a method to sum up it's collection, this method uses a wrapper to time it's output time. 

### Implementation Notes

    ~ pytest

    I find it interesting taht you can use dunder methods in order to call for things in specific ways that allow the top level methods to work. This is something taht I'd like to learn more about, I see them used in programs frequently in order to modfiy functionality as you need it. 

    One thing I'm super happy about is learning to use wrappers, I feel like this is something you could use in order to do scores and things like that, checking how long it took someone to complete something, or even making sure that the right information is being passes and captured before something is run. It helps create a bit of a template to work off of and I think that's really cool.
